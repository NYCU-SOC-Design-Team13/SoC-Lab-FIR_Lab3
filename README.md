# SoC-Lab-FIR
SoC_Lab3

## Interface
- data_in stream (Xn)
- data_out: stream (Yn)
- coef[Tape_Num-1:0] axilite
- len: axilite 
- ap_start: axilite 
- ap_done: axilite

## Specification
* Data width: 32
* Number of tap coefficients: 11
* Number of data is determined by the testbench <br><br>
* Only use one Multiplier and one Adder
  *  Shift register implemented with SRAM (Shift_RAM, size = 10 DW) – size = 10 DW
* Tap coefficient implemented with SRAM (Tap_RAM = 11 DW) and initialized by axilite write
* Operation
  * Set ap_start to initiate FIR engine (ap_start valid for one clock cycle)
  * Stream in Xn. The input rate is depending on the FIR processing speed. Use AXI-Stream valid/ready for flow control
  * Stream out Yn. The output rate depends on the FIR processing speed
